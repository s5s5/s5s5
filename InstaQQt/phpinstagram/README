Why?
====

Instagram has not yet released its api although already using one.
I captured my iphones traffic using wireshark and reverse engineered
the api they use.

Completeness?
=============

The API is by far not complete. The only part that is done by now is
reading your's and other persons feed. Feel free to extend the api,
some files already exist and contain information about the urls and
parameters instagram expects.

Requirements?
=============

This API-implementation is based on Zend Framework (its autoloader and
on Zend_HTTP_Client which is very useful over plain curl ;)

Examples?
=========

See docs/example/example.php and docs/example/bootstrap.php - you will
find a script that checks your feed and is also able to show other
persons feed.

Feel free to use this scripts for whatever reason you might need it.
